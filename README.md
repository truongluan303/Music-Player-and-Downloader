# Music-Player-and-Downloader

This python program is a music player that allows the users to download a song from youtube and then play all the songs that have been downloaded.
The user can choose a playlist to download songs to. To download a song, the user only needs to enter the song's name and the artist's name, and then
hit download. After downloading all the songs that they want, the user can then choose a playlist to start playing music.

The music player is implemented using a circular doubly linked list to easily move from one song to another in both forward and backward direction.

The two main libraries that this program use are youtube-dl (to download song from youtube), and pyglet (to play sound). These libraries will automatically
be installed at the very first time the program is run so the user does not need to install anything.
